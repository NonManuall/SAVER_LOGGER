🛡️ SAVER_LOGGER - Burp Suite Extension
Author: Sachhit Anasane

🔍 Introduction
SAVER_LOGGER is a professionally engineered Burp Suite extension developed for reliable, enterprise-grade logging of every HTTP request across all Burp tools — including Proxy, Scanner, Repeater, Intruder, Collaborator, and Dashboard. It captures detailed request metadata and ensures automated log preservation, even in the event of unexpected shutdowns or crashes.

🎯 Real-World Use Case & Critical Need
In modern security assessments and incident response scenarios, proving the legitimacy and accuracy of testing logs is crucial. Organizations often face:

Regulatory audits requiring timestamped testing logs

Client reporting obligations with evidence of methodology

Post-breach investigations needing exact attack footprints

Technical failures (e.g., Burp state file corruption, crashes)

Without dependable logs, credibility and accountability can be compromised.

SAVER_LOGGER eliminates this risk by persistently recording and exporting logs — maintaining verifiable records of request activity, even if Burp is closed accidentally. It ensures traceability, reproducibility, and legal defensibility for your testing work.

✅ Active Scan Integration
